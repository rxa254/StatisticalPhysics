\section{Heat and Work: May 19}

This week, the objective is to study how heat and work behave in exchange between systems so that we can understand how practical devices work.\\

For a system with fixed number of particles $N$, the total internal energy can be expressed as a function of the entropy and volume:
\begin{equation}
dU = \tau d\sigma - p dV
\end{equation}
where the negative sign in the second term indicates that this is work done \textit{by} the system on the environment (it decreases the energy of the system). \emph{Decreasing} the volume of the system \emph{increases} its internal energy.

For a system with fixed $N$, there are a number of different ways to perform work on a system other than the obvious mechanical way of compression/expansion (such as changing the external magnetic field).

There are illuminating Flash animations of a few different heat engines from Don Ion at Santa Barbara:
\url{http://science.sbcc.edu/~physics/flash/index.html}. The Carnot cycle is described in the textbook,
the 4-stroke engine (Otto) is the basic model of today's internal combustion engine in many cars, and
the Stirling cycle, which is very popular recenly due to its high efficiency and closed cycle operation.

\subsubsection{The Carnot Cycle}
The Carnot Cycle (named after Sadi Carnot) is an ideal version of a heat engine. A system (the engine) sits between a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir. Heat, $Q_h$, is extracted from hot reservoir at temperature $\tau_h$ and used to do some work. The system then ejects heat, $Q_l$, into a cold reservoir at temperature $\tau_l$ and then returns to its initial position. In the ideal Carnot picture, the engine is unchanged by this process and so the entropy remains constant: $\sigma_h = \sigma_l$

The amount of work done by the engine can, at best, be the difference in the heat extracted and the heat which is dumped to the cold reservoir.

\begin{equation}
W = Q_h - Q_l = \frac{\tau_h - \tau_l}{\tau_h} Q_h
\end{equation}

the Carnot efficiency is defined as the ratio of the work done to the heat extracted from the reservoir:
\begin{equation}
\eta \equiv \frac{W}{Q_h} = 1 - \tau_l/\tau_h
\end{equation}

The P-V and T-S diagrams (from Thermopedia \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1615/AtoZ.c.carnot_cycle})

give graphical representations of the amount of work done.

\subsection{Refridgeration}



\subsection{Thermodynamic Impossibilities}
One of the practical uses of a knowledge of thermodynamics is the ability to debunk scientific frauds in the form of impossible heat engines, perpetual motion machines, devices which produce 'free energy' from the 'energy of empty space', etc.
