In this problem we will use a lattice model to study a system with a gas adsorbing onto a surface.

Consider a lattice of sites, each of which can contain either 0 or 1 particle. 
There are $M$ bulk sites and $N$ surface sites. The gas consists of $N$ total particles, 
with $n \leq N$ particles located on surface sites. A particle has energy $-\epsilon$ when 
on a surface site and $0$ when on a bulk site. $M, N$, and $\epsilon$ are all constants; $n$ is a
variable. $M, N$, and $n$ are all very large.

a) What is the energy of the system when $n$ surface sites are occupied?

b) Find the entropy as a function of $n$.

c) Derive an expression relating $n$ to the temperature of the system. You do not 
have to solve the expression to find an explicit relation $n = n(T)$.

d) Find $n$ when $T = 0$.

e) Find the limit of $n/N$ as $T \rightarrow \infty$.
